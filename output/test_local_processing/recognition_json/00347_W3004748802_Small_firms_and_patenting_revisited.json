We argue that size differ-\nences in the probability to patent relate primarily to the\n“ portfolio effect, ” i.e., larger firms generate more inno-\nvations than smaller firms, and therefore are more likely\nto create one or more which are patentable.

There are several\nseparate strands of argument that contribute to this be-\nlief. The work of Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh ( 2000 )\nsuggested that small firms are a distinct group and prefer\nto protect their intellectual property using non-patent\nmethods. Why should this be the case? Two types of\nexplanations dominate the literature. The first argues\nthat small firms may simply be less familiar with formal\nIP mechanisms. As Hall, Helmers, Rogers, and Sena\n( 2013 ) note in their analysis of UK firms “ Because firms\nthat use one IP mechanism are more likely to use anoth-\ner, another possibility is that firms have a “ propensity ”\nto use or not use IP, and that the problem is lack of\nfamiliarity with the system and sub-optimal behavior on\nthe part of some firms ” . The second explanation in the\nresearch literature and public policy documents is that\ndue to resource constraints and/or registration and de-\nfense costs, patenting is of little value, as an intellectual\nproperty (IP) protection mechanism for small firms\n(Hughes & Mina, 2010 ; Athreye & Fassio, 2018 ) ."

As we noted in Section 2 , not being able\nto observe how many innovations a firm produces\nmakes it difficult to disentangle the portfolio and pro-\npensity to patent effects. To address this, we define our\ndependent variable in two ways. First, the survey instru-\nment used in SIPU looks at the probability of applying\nfor a patent for firms' most commercially valuable in-\nnovation. The reasoning here is that an innovation\nwhich makes the most money for the company is also\nthe innovation that it is most likely to be worth\nprotecting through formal IP. Second, while the number\nof innovations of a firm is not observable, many respon-\ndents can say with some degree of certainty what per-\ncentage of their innovations is protected by patents and\nother formal IP strategies. This is an effective way of de-\nscaling patenting. The survey instrument in UKIS 2015\nasks exactly this kind of a question."

The existing\nevidence, suggesting that on average small firms have\na lower patent propensity with respect to medium and\nlarge firms, is indeed confirmed by the statistics from\nUKIS firms. Table 4 , column (2) shows that the share of\nsmall-firm innovators who applied for at least one patent\nin the UKIS is less than 20 % , significantly different in\nstatistical terms from the share of innovators who patent\namong medium firms (26.5 % ) and large firms (33 % ).\nThese differences reflect both the propensity to patent\nindividual innovations and the breadth of firms' portfo-\nlio of innovations. When, however, we focus only on the\nmost significant innovation, removing any portfolio ef-\nfect (Table 5a , column 4), we find that there are no large\ndifferences among firms of different size, i.e., among the\nSIPU innovators, we find no evidence of size effects in\nthe propensity to patent their most valuable invention. A\nfirst explanation of these results could be that, consider-\ning that patenting is a costly strategic decision taken by\nfirms, financially constrained small firms will only ap-\nply for a patent when the value of their innovation is\nsufficiently high to motivate their investment."

Note, however, that both for\nsmall and medium firms, coefficients are negative but\ninsignificant. The implication is that there is no signifi-\ncant difference in the probability that smaller firms and\nlarge firms will patent their most valuable innovation,\nand that it is therefore the portfolio effect rather than the\npropensity to innovate effect which explains the differ-\nence between the probability of small and large firm\npatenting."

In other words,\nthe propensity to patent any specific innovation is\nbroadly similar in firms of all sizes. The implication is\nthat differences in the probability that smaller and larger\nfirms will patent relate not to a “ propensity to patent ”\neffect but primarily to the “ effect. ” i.e., larger firms\ncreate a greater number of innovations than smaller\nfirms and therefore are simply more likely to create\none or more which are patentable.

Policy concerns about lower patenting rates\namong smaller firms may therefore be misplaced being\ninstead a natural consequence of firm size differences\nand the fact that large firms typically have a larger\nnumber of patentable innovations. Issues do remain,\nhowever, about small firms engagement with patenting\nparticularly as small firms are more likely to cite cost\nbarriers to patenting than larger firms (Table 8 ), and any\ncost reductions may therefore have a disproportionate\neffect on smaller firms. Yet, although the costs of\npatenting are well known and understood (WIPO,\nundated), this is an area where policy measures are\nlimited. For example, in the UK,, patenting and trade\nmark costs are explicitly excluded from the eligible\nexpenses which are covered by R & D tax credits for all\nsizes of firms although these costs may be offset using\nother tax breaks. $^15$ Most policy initiatives targeted at\nsmall firms have instead concentrated on creating\nawareness and educating small firms about the value\nof patenting. Helping smaller firms to offset the costs of\nobtaining patents by extending the eligible expenses for\nR & D tax credits would increase patent use by smaller\nfirms. Alongside this, it has been suggested that small\nfirms may be helped by establishing patent litigation\ninsurance schemes which could help with the costs of\ndefending patents (CJA Consultants Ltd, 2006 ) with\nsome countries (China, Japan) offering subsidies to\nsmall firms to join private IP insurance schemes\n(EUIPO, 2018 , p. 6)."
